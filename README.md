# Derivative of Pix - OOP Project
This project is a basic level two dimensional implementation of Minecraft game. It contains three screens:
- Home Screen:

When the executable file is ran, the home screeen appears up. It has 2 options, **Play** which directs us to play screen (discussed later) and the **Exit** option which closes the game.
