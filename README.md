# Derivative of Pix - OOP Project
This project is a basic level two dimensional implementation of Minecraft game. It contains three screens:
- Home Screen - When the executable file is ran, the home screeen appears up. It has 2 options, **Play** which directs us to play screen (discussed later) and the **Exit** option which closes the game.
- Game Screen - This screen is where the user interacts with the player and moves it. It creates the whole game environment which is being discussed below in "How to Play" section.
- Storage Screen - This screen is accessed via game screen and its details can be found in the "How to Play" section below
